# Topological Data Analysis

Within this repository, you will discover the solutions to the exercises of the [Topological Data Analysis](https://ti.inf.ethz.ch/ew/courses/TDA23/index.html) course at ETH, which my team and I undertook during the spring semester of 2023. Additionally you can find a proof done by me of a variant of the [Helly's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helly%27s_theorem), which was part of the first graded assignment of the course. It is important to note that we do not claim to guarantee the correctness or completeness of every exercise.
